# PowerMonitor

This node is built with a Particle Photon and a ATM90E36 board bought from whatnick's tindie page.

Uses MQTT to report to the MQTT/Openhab server.

This was a fast turn-key approach to sampling 3 phase power and current, and should be better than the previous install.

Bits borrowed from https://github.com/whatnick/ATM90E36_Arduino with modifications for Photon SPI.

# Calibration

Need to calibrate against Fluke current clamp. Left it at work by accident...

#Network Monitoring

The plan is to do regular speedtests to watch down/up speed over time, and monitor internal hardware.

# Internet

It seems internet tests are already a solved issue:

This has been implemeted.

# SNMP Network

The modem, ubiquiti wireless AP, and QNAP nas all support SNMP monitoring.

Ideally wireless speeds and states, along with storage and qnap load would be shown.
